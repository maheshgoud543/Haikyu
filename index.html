        <p>Hinata listens to "I want to be tall" by Jenna Marbles everyday in hopes that it will help him grow taller. 
            Someday he hopes his dream will finally come true.</p>

        <p>Sugawara seems to ship Kageyama and Hinata; especially when he mentions Hinata's expression when he hits his sets isn't the same as when Hinata hits Kageyama's sets and only 
            Kageyama can get Hinata to use his abilities to 100%.</p>

        <p>Hinata is surprised that he does not end up in more fights with how much he says, "fight me."</p>

        <p>According to Tanaka, the only type of movie Nishinoya will watch is over-the-top action,
             where he usually yells in excitement in the middle of the film.
